# Frontend Knowledge
1. What do you know about the React.js library? Summarize in 1-2 paragraphs using your own words.
2. If there are any existing design errors in a website's frontend, what would be the best action to improve it?
   Say, for example, these [two photos](https://github.com/Daaaaaav/pusb2025-webdevgift/blob/main/example-images.zip) that have different dimensions being placed side-by-side. Please create an aesthetically-pleasing frontend design solution using the React.js library (any framework is welcome) and TailwindCSS to fix this issue.
3. Create an admin panel with an integrated Login Page and 3 different pages with CRUD functionalities using React.js library (any framework is welcome, plus points if using TailwindCSS for the design).
4. Are you confident in updating the frontend code frequently (at least monthly) whilst keeping up with the latest PUSB news? 

# Backend Knowledge
1. What do you know about Golang? Summarize in 1-2 paragraphs using your own words.
2. Create a solution using Golang (free to use Gin or other frameworks) that maintains at least 3 tables in a database with each integrated for CRUD functionality. Linking the backend codes with the answer for number 3 of Frontend Knowledge is more than welcome. 
3. How would you personally secure your backend from XSS attacks and rate limit? Please keep in consideration that it is in Golang.
4. If the database of your website were to suddenly disconnect with the hosting server of your choice, how would you deal with such situations?

# CI/CD Knowledge

3. Are you confident in updating the website's codes from your local computer  via Docker containers and checking Vercel connectivity to the hosting server of your choice regularly (at least in a monthly frequency)?
4. If the DNS were to suddenly be down, what actions would you personally take first?
